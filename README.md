# eris-event-api
Implementing an event queue on Eris (or Ethereum) blockchain

This is NOT well-tested, but just my own proof-of-concept to see if we can emulate a pub-sub system using Eris blockchain.
It was developed based on Eris 0.12, but the smart contract is developed using Truffle. So it works fine in Ethereum as well.
